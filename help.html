		<h1 class="title">How you can help</h1>

		<p class="main" id="help">We have created two solutions to alleviate the effects of extreme heat on Manufactured and Mobile Homes.

Our first solution is a decision tool that allows park residents, managers, and owners to find out what solution or system of solutions will work best for them. The user will plug in site-specific conditions (Budget, Avg Peak Temp, etc.) and the tool will take these factors into consideration and suggest the most effective set of solutions for the given situation.

Our second solution is an early warning detection system. This will consist of a temperature and humidity sensor that will constantly monitor real-time temperature and humidity. If the temperature reaches an unsafe level for an extended period of time a text notification will be sent to the designated phone number which will be set by the user. The message will alert them of the unsafe conditions as well as describe the symptoms of heatstroke and some tactics for the user to cool themself down.
