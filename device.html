		<p class="main">We created our signature Heat Warning Detection System that monitors and alerts residents to keep them safe in times of need. When designing our Temperature / Humidity Sensor, we prioritized a low-cost design to maximize the accessibility of our device so that we could better serve our target communities. This meant low power usage, inexpensive hardware, and simple yet robust system architecture. </p>
